# Rugby Revenue & Performance Analysis (Currie Cup 2025 – Simulated Data)

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between **team performance** and **ticket revenue** in the Currie Cup (2025, simulated dataset).  
It combines **match data** (scores, attendance, revenue) and **player statistics** (tries, tackles, carries, etc.) to demonstrate how rugby analytics can connect **on-field success** with **financial outcomes**.

---

## Objectives
- Identify which teams generated the highest **ticket revenue**.  
- Analyze team scoring patterns and performance.  
- Profile top-performing players (tries, tackles).  
- Explore the **correlation between winning matches and revenue generation**.  

---

## Dataset
- **matches.csv** – 56 matches with fields: teams, scores, attendance, ticket prices, gate revenue.  
- **player_stats.csv** – 1,680 player-level entries with detailed performance metrics.  

---

## Key Findings
1. Teams with consistently high **attendance and ticket prices** generated the most revenue.  
2. Top try scorers and tacklers were successfully identified, showcasing standouts.  
3. There is a **positive correlation between team wins and revenue** — winning more games leads to greater ticket sales and higher financial returns.  
4. Some teams with **strong fan bases** maintained high revenues despite mixed performance, showing the dual role of performance and loyalty.
